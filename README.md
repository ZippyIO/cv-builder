An application to quickly generate a CV based on your:

-   General Information:
    -   Name
    -   Email
    -   Phone Number

This project was built with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) to solidify my knowledge working with React Props & State as an assignment in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum - [Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript).

## Demo
